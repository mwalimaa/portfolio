Explore away!\r\nBackground\r\nIn January 2021, the Biden administration announced that the United States will work toward the goal of conserving 30% of U.S. lands and oceans by 2030, also known as the “30 by 30” initiative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: A snippet from the 30x30 initiative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEcologists and conservationists everywhere applauded this initiative as our careers are often devoted to protecting the natural systems that all life relies on. Brandon and I were also happy to hear this announcement, but as scientists we had questions lingering within our discussions:\r\nWhat do they mean by “conserving” land? Will these be untouched wilderness areas to protect biodiversity, or will they be protected from development but still logged?\r\nHow will they conserve land? Will they conserve sagebrush scrubland in Nevada and ignore the old-growth forests in Oregon, and call it “good”?\r\nHow do we currently define “conservation” in the United States?\r\nHow can we assess where we are at and how much more we have to go?\r\nDatasets\r\nThe Nature Conservancy Terrestrial Ecoregions, 2016\r\nDivides the country into geographic regions based on similar climate, vegetation, geology, and other ecological and environmental patterns.\r\nWe chose this dataset because it separates the country into regions based on ecological similarities rather than political boundaries.\r\nIt can be accessed here.\r\nUSGS Protected Areas Database of the United States 2.0, 2018\r\nA national inventory of the nation’s protected areas, including public land and private protected areas.\r\nWe chose this dataset because it is the most complete, credible resource available, plus it defines different rankings of ecological protection.\r\nGAP Status:\r\nLevel 1: Areas managed for biodiversity where natural disturbances are allowed to proceed.\r\nLevel 2: Areas managed for biodiversity where natural disturbance is suppressed.\r\nLevel 3: Areas protected from land conversion, but subject to extractive uses.\r\n\r\nIt can be accessed here.\r\nLANDFIRE Existing Vegetation Type 2.2.0, 2016\r\nShows the distribution of vegetative communities across the United States at 30 x 30 m resolution.\r\nWe chose this dataset because it is a detailed, yet broad, description of ecosystems across the country, which is perfect for identifying major ecosystems within an ecoregion.\r\nIt can be accessed here.\r\nMethods\r\nCropped the Ecoregion and Protected Areas Database (PADUS) shapefiles to the continental United States.\r\nExtracted Existing Vegetation Type (EVT) counts within each Ecoregion as a whole and displayed it as a data frame. Performed the same process on PADUS areas within each Ecoregion.\r\nJoined both datasets by Ecoregion. Summarized total acres and total acres protected at each GAP status.\r\nCalculated relative percentages of ecosystem conservation under three protection regimes: fully natural processes (GAP 1), prioritize biodiversity (GAP 1, 2), prevent land conversion (GAP 1, 2, 3).\r\nCalculated the relative percentages of EVTs occurring inside and outside protected areas of each Ecoregion, using 30% representation as the goal.\r\nDiscussion\r\n25.5% of land is protected from development or conversion, and more than half is subject to resource extraction.\r\n9.9% of land is protected for biodiversity purposes.\r\nOnly 4.2% of land is protected for biodiversity and allow for all natural ecological processes to occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: All protected lands in United States under each GAP status. Black dashed line is total percent protected under GAP 1, 2, 3 and red dashed line is our 30% goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow should we define “conservation” in the United States?\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it solely to prevent conversion to subdivisions or agriculture? Are we allowed to systematically extract resources from it, effectively disturbing natural regimes? If so, we have less than 5% to go.\r\nDo we prioritize biodiversity and prevent significant human impact from disrupting natural processes? If this is the avenue we take, we have about 20% more to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: All protected lands in United States under each GAP status. Black dashed line is total protected under GAP 1, 2, 3 and red dashed line is our 30% goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it valuable to consider what types of land we choose to protect moving forward?\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause Biden’s plan is to conserve 30% of U.S. land, we decided that 30% of each ecosystem type should also be protected, in order to properly represent the ecosystems and their functions. This way, we don’t have 27% sagebrush, 2% northern hardwoods, 1% old growth conifer forest, and 0% oak savanna in our protected areas. How is that conservation?\r\n45.8% of EVTs are protected from land conversion at 30% or greater representation.\r\n22.6% of EVTs are protected for biodiversity at 30% or greater representation.\r\nThis is an interactive map. It shows GAP status and ecosystem types for each Ecoregion. The layers can be toggled on/off on the upper left side, below the zoom controls.

She developed a project idea and began researching her question, “How does the historical ecosystem patterns of the Driftless Region compare to the current ecosystem patterns?” The Driftless Region is 15.4 million acres of land at the crossroads of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, and Iowa that the glaciers avoided during the last ice age. Since there were no glaciers to flatten the landscape and deposit glacial drift (hence the name), the rolling landscape is a unique example of Midwest geography and ecology pre-ice age.

LANDFIRE Existing Vegetation Type (EVT) data was used to assess the current ecosystem distribution.\r\nI tag-teamed with her to finish this project, as I had more GIS experience than she did (at the time). We wanted to display the changes that Driftless Region experienced before and after colonization. At this point I had lots of experience with ArcGIS Pro while in college, but had to find an alternative software since I no longer had an ESRI license after graduating. This is where I stumbled upon QGIS and began teaching myself this software. I reclassified (using R) the BPS raster into 5 broad categories: Oak and Pine, Prairie, Paleozoic Bluff and Talus, Mesophytic, and Riparian and Wetland.
